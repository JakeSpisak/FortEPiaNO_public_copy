FORTran-Evolved PrImordiAl Neutrino Oscillations  
by S. Gariazzo (stefano.gariazzo@gmail.com) and P.F. de Salas ()

FortEPiaNO is a Fortran code to compute the evolution of neutrino oscillations in the early universe.  
The code is written to flexible, it can work with two to six neutrinos (active or sterile).  
At the moment, no lepton asymmetries nor non-standard interactions are implemented.

## 1.Install and compile
Clone the repository ... or download its content ..., go to folder, compile with `make`, run with `bin/fortepiano ini/explanatory.ini`

The `ini/explanatory.ini` contains a detailled description of the various arguments that the fortran code accepts, and shows how to pass the neutrino mixing parameters.

### 1.1.More on compiling
The Makefile should automatically recognize which compiler to use.
If it is present, `ifort` will be used by default, otherwise the GNU fortran compiler `gfortran` is used.
To force compilation with a `gfortran` when `ifort` exists, use `make F90=gfortran`.

Compiled modules are stored in the `build/` folder by default. You can however specify the folder where to save the builds using `BUILD_DIR`, for example `make BUILD_DIR=newbuildfolder`.
If you set the build folder to `build_debug`, a set of options useful for debug will be used for compiling.

Additional commands for the makefile include:
* `make clean` to remove all compiled files.
* `make tests` to compile a set of numerical tests (run them with `bin/tests`). If you modify the code, they will tell you if everything is still working as expected.

## 2.Python scripts
Some useful python scripts are delivered together with the main fortran code.

### 2.1.`prepareIni.py`
Tool that will help to generate an ini file, using default values for the non-specified parameters.
Use `python python/prepareIni.py -h` to get a list of accepted arguments and their description.
Currently accepts only up to 4 neutrinos (3 active + 1 sterile)

### 2.2.`readOutput.py`
Functions to read the output files generated by the fortran code and generate plots.
It can be used importing the main class `...`, for example:
```
from fortepianoOutput import FortEPiaNORun
run = FortEPiaNORun("output/folder/", nnu=4, plots=True)
```
For possible plotting functions include:
* ...

### 2.3.`dogrid3p1.py`
Functions to generate the ini files, submit runs, produce plots for a specific grid.
See `python python/dogrid3p1.py -h` for a detailled description of the accepted arguments.

## 3.Source code
Should you need to edit the source codes, this is more or less the content of each file:
* `config.f90`: routines for the initialization;
* `const.f90`: constants, variables, interfaces;
* `cosmology.f90`: energy density of the various species;
* `equations.f90`: evolution equations of the various quantities;
* `interactions.f90`: functions that define the neutrino interactions and the collision terms;
* `fortepiano.f90`: main program.

Auxiliary files:
* `bspline*`: spline interpolation utilities;
* `errors.f90`: error and log management;
* `heigensystem.f90`: complex matrix diagonalization;
* `iniFile.f90`: functions to read the input file;
* `linear_interpolation_module.f90`: linear interpolation utilities;
* `matrix_utils.f90`: utilities for creating and manipulating matrices;
* `odepack*`: DLSODA and related utilities;
* `stuff.f90`: old functions that were used in previous versions of the code and now enter only the tests;
* `tests.f90`: numerical tests for the software;
* `test_utils.f90`: assertion functions and test counts;
* `utilities.f90`: utilities for integration, interpolation, checkpointing, log file manipulation, time measurements.
