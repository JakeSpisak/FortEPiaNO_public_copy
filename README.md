# FORTran-Evolved PrImordiAl Neutrino Oscillations
# by S. Gariazzo (stefano.gariazzo@gmail.com) and P.F. de Salas ()

FortEPiaNO is a Fortran code to compute the evolution of neutrino oscillations in the early universe.
The code is written to flexible, it can work with two to six neutrinos (active or sterile).

## 1.Install and compile
Clone the repository ... or download its content ..., go to folder, compile with `make`, run with `bin/fortepiano.exe ini/explanatory.ini`

The `ini/explanatory.ini` contains a detailled description of the various arguments that the fortran code accepts.

### 1.1.More on compiling
Compiled by default with `ifort`, if present.
To force compilation with a `gfortran`, use `make F90=gfortran`
Compiled modules are stored in the `build/` folder by default. To change this, compile with `BUILD_DIR`,
for example `make BUILD_DIR=newbuildfolder`.
`make clean` to remove all compiled files.
`make tests && bin/tests` will run a set of numerical tests. If you modify the code, they will tell you if everything is still working as expected.

## 2.Python scripts
Some useful python scripts are delivered together with the main fortran code.

### 2.1.`prepareIni.py`
Tool that will help to generate an ini file, using default values for the non-specified parameters.
Use `python python/prepareIni.py -h` to get a list of accepted arguments and their description.
Currently accepts only up to 4 neutrinos (3 active + 1 sterile)

### 2.2.`readOutput.py`
Functions to read the output files generated by the fortran code and generate plots.
It can be used importing the main class `...`, for example:
```
from nuDensOutput import NuDensRun
run = NuDensRun("output/folder/", nnu=4, plots=True)
```
For possible plotting functions include:
* ...

### 2.3.`dogrid3p1.py`
Functions to generate the ini files, submit runs, produce plots for a specific grid.
See `python python/dogrid3p1.py -h` for a detailled description of the accepted arguments.
